# 🌍 Biogas Microgrid for Rural Households  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project models a **small-scale biogas system** designed to meet the cooking needs of **20 households in the Wumba district, Abuja, FCT**.  
It integrates **community-level data collection**, **data analysis**, and **system design** to demonstrate how local waste resources can be transformed into sustainable energy.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Survey households to estimate **daily cooking gas demand** and available kitchen waste.
2. Survey community abattoir and farms to also estimate the animal waste and dung that can be obtained.
3. Model a **biogas system** using anaerobic digestion of household waste.  
4. Size the system to meet cooking/heating needs.

5. ---**In progress**
6. Extend the design into a **hybrid microgrid** by adding solar PV for electricity.  
7. Analyze cost, sustainability, and scalability for underserved communities.

## 🔬 Methodology  

### 1. Community Data Collection  
- Survey 20 households and agriculture in Wumba → daily cooking fuel use, farm waste, food waste, kitchen waste.  
- Convert waste → methane potential (kg waste → m³ CH₄).  

### 2. Biogas Process Simulation  
- Tools: **Aspen Plus / Python**.  
- Inputs: waste feedstock (composition), water, digester conditions (temperature, pH, retention time).  
- Outputs: methane yield, digestate.  

### 3. Energy System Design  
- Convert methane yield → cooking gas (LPG/Charcoal equivalent).  

### 4. Analysis  
- Compare household needs vs the system output.

## 🌍 Impact  
- Demonstrates how these rural communities can use their **local waste → clean energy**.  
- Provides an **affordable alternative** to depleting cooking gas and other fuels.  
- Offers a **scalable model** for sustainable energy access in Africa.
