# 🌱🏡 Biogas System for Wumba District

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project models a **small-scale biogas system** designed to meet the cooking needs of **20 households in the Wumba district, Abuja, FCT Nigeria**.  
It integrates **community-level data collection**, **data analysis**, and **system design** to demonstrate how local waste resources can be transformed into sustainable energy.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Survey households to estimate **daily cooking energy demand** and available kitchen waste.
2. Survey community abattoir and cattle rearers to also estimate the animal waste and dung that can be obtained.
3. Calculate the biogas potential from available waste.
4. Model a **biogas system** using anaerobic digestion of household waste.  
5. Size the biogas digester required to meet cooking needs.

## 🔬 Methodology  

### 1. Community Data Collection  
- Survey 20 households, farm, markets in Wumba
- Get values for → daily cooking fuel use, farm waste, food waste, kitchen waste.  
- Convert waste → useful energy potential (kg waste → m³ CH₄).  

### 2. Biogas Process Simulation  
- Tools: **Aspen Plus / Python**.  
- Inputs: waste feedstock (composition), water, digester conditions (temperature, pH, retention time).  
- Outputs: methane yield, digestate.  

### 3. Energy System Design  
- Convert methane yield → cooking gas (LPG/Charcoal equivalent).  

### 4. Analysis  
- Compare household needs vs the system output.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Excel** → Household survey data
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy  
- **Aspen Plus** → Biogas modeling

## 📌 Impact  
- Demonstrates how these rural communities can use their **local waste → clean energy**.  
- Provides an **affordable alternative** to depleting cooking gas and other fuels.  
- Offers a **scalable model** for sustainable energy access in Africa.

## 📝 Assumptions:  
- Literature biogas yields (m³/kg fresh waste).
- Volatile Solids: 80%
- Feedstock TS fractions: kitchen 20%, cow dung 12%, meat waste 25%.  
- Slurry target TS: 8%.  
- HRT = 30 days, safety buffer ×1.5.
